# Progress

## 2026-08-05

Initial project foundation created for the browser-based validation demo.

Completed:

- Added a minimal Next.js portal scaffold under `apps/portal`
- Added a minimal Python voice worker scaffold under `workers/voice`
- Added a placeholder `supabase/` project folder
- Added root environment example files
- Added baseline formatting, linting, and test configuration files
- Added simple health endpoints for the portal and voice worker
- Added minimal local setup instructions in `README.md`

Verified:

- `node --check apps/portal/app/api/health/route.js`
- `node --check apps/portal/lib/health.js`
- `node --check apps/portal/next.config.mjs`
- `node --test apps/portal/tests/health.test.mjs`
- `python3.11 -m compileall workers/voice/app`
- `python3.11 -m unittest discover -s workers/voice/tests -t workers/voice -p "test_*.py"`

Not yet verified:

- Next.js build, dev server, and ESLint execution because dependencies have not been installed yet
- Portal JSX files with a framework-aware compiler or linter
- Git-based diff hygiene checks because the workspace is not currently an initialized Git repository
